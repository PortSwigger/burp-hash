<p>This extension passively scans requests looking for values containing hashes 
using common algorithms (SHA, MD5, etc.). Observed hashes are reported to the 
user.</p>
<p>Additionally, the extension keeps track of submitted parameter values, such 
as usernames, email addresses, and ID numbers. When a hash of a previously 
submitted value is identified, this is also reported to the user.</p>
<p>Here is a brief video that explains the concept: <a href="https://youtu.be/KdgeipzmESE">https://youtu.be/KdgeipzmESE</a>.</p>
